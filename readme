Models: The trained models. 
glove.840B.300d_aligned.pt: the glove vectors aligned with the vocabulary corresponding to the data.

*The following above two have to downloaded from:

Though, no other alternative libraries have not been used. So, the code should run on any regular Pytorch environment. Still, the environment corresponding to the code is provided in rajeev3.yml file.

eval_logs: evaluation logs for all the models
runs: Tensorboard logs. 

The main scripts are:
train.py: To train the models. Please use train.py -h to see the arguments.
eval.py: To evaluate the models on validation and test data. Again, please follow the eval.py -h to see the args.
predict.py: This script takes encoder type, and premise-hypothesis pair to predict the relation between them.
